# 🏥 Healthcare SQL + Python Portfolio Project

### 📊 Hospital Performance & Patient Analytics  
**Tools Used:** Python · SQLite · Pandas · Matplotlib · Seaborn · Scipy · Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores synthetic healthcare data to uncover meaningful insights around hospital admissions, patient billing, medications, and diagnostic test results.

The notebook uses **SQL inside Python** to run powerful queries, clean the data, analyze key patterns, and present business-relevant findings for a hospital management context.

---

## 📁 Dataset Structure

The project works with 7 linked tables:
- `patients`
- `admissions`
- `hospitals`
- `doctors`
- `billing`
- `medications`
- `test_results`

---

## 📌 Key Steps

### ✅ Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values and duplicates
- Verified data types and column formats

### ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- SQL preview of all key tables
- Column and row count validations

### ✅ Deep Analysis
- **Admissions**: Most common types, trends over time, top hospitals
- **Billing**: Paid vs billed amounts, revenue gaps, payment status analysis
- **Medications**: Most prescribed meds, Emergency vs Elective patient differences
- **Test Results**: Distribution, average by test type, abnormality detection

### ✅ Statistical Testing
- **Correlation**: Billing vs Length of Stay
- **T-Test**: Emergency vs Elective stay durations
- **Null Hypothesis** clearly defined and evaluated

---

## 📈 Visuals
- Horizontal and vertical bar charts
- Line charts for monthly trends
- Histograms for distribution insights
- Value labels added for clarity

---

## 💡 Final Business Insights

- Emergency admissions lead to slightly longer stays on average
- Payment status heavily skewed toward “Partially Paid” in synthetic dataset
- Revenue gaps are significant due to unpaid billing amounts
- Medications vary clearly between Emergency and Elective patients
- Test results are normally distributed with no major outliers
